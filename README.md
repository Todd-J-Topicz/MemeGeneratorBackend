# MVP - React Front End

## Description
A full stack application using the PERN stack, PostgrSQL, Express routes, React front-end and Node JS framework, that allows a user to generate a random image from an external API, then create custom text at the top and bottom of the image to create a final meme. Added functionality allows the user to save each created meme, delete any memes and view all memes (update memes will be added), to a locally running PostgrSQL database.
